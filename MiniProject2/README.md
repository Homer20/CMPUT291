# Method of Coordination
Coordination was done through Discord, where we had meetings to check in with each other and update our progress along the way.
After completing each small sections, we would have meetings. This is how progress was made, and we ensured that the project was
on track to be completed on time.

# Code execution guide
To run the code, first run the build and then the query files. Both of these should be done in the command line and have the port number as an argument.
Here is how to run Task 1 on port 27017:

python task1_build.py 27017  
  python task1_query.py 27017

The same can be done for Task 2, just replace it with task2_build.py and task2_query.py

# Collaborations
We did not collaborate with anyone else
